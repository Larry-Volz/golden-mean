# The Golden Mean
## an app to help people find balance through practical wisdom and self-understanding
The Golden Mean is inspired by Aristotle's virtue theory.  This app at its' start is a series of sliders for each of the ten balances.
Eventual possibilities for this are to:
- add a present condition slider and a goal marker
- have login/db/monitoring capability with timers to remind you to log yourself
- graphs to show how you are improving in each area
- give advice on areas where you aren't doing well - mantras, exercises and ways to get into more resourceful states of mind
- integrate it into American Hypnotherapy Association website

## Current State
presently just the sliders and artwork for about half of them

## Next steps
- finish UI artwork
- do the JS for sliders
- set up the PostgreSQL/SQLAlchemy database system
- consider simplifying it into less categories while maintaining the integrity of the system
